This repository for the AboutCode public website. It is based on Docusaurus.
This website is currently in Alpha-pilot state with a primary focus on content over format.
- Please do not submit pull requests unless you find an issue labelled as "good first issue".
- If you do submit a pull request:
   - DO NOT use CoPilot or other AI tools to create the PR or its content. AboutCode does not accept AI-generated PRs and dealing with takes away valuable time for our core work.
   - Do not include changes to the current project configuration - e.g., do not include an updated package-lock.json or yarn.lock in a PR to update content.
   - Do not add new dependencies with your PR.

The current draft website is available at: https://aboutcode-org.github.io/www.aboutcode.org/.
