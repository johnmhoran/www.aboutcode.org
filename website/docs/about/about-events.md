## Upcoming Events

### FOSDEM 2026

We regularly participate in **FOSDEM**, one of the largest gatherings of Free 
and Open Source Software developers in the world. The 2026 conference will be
held on January 31 and February 1 in Brussels, Belgium.

Since 2024 we have been hosting a workshop before FOSDEM to bring together 
users and developers of FOSS tools for license and security compliance. 
You will need to register for the workshop because we need to manage the 
number of attendees in our conference space. We request that you help sponsor 
the workshop with a donation, but sponsorship is not required to attend.
