# Getting started

The AboutCode community designs, develops, and sustains an open source
ecosystem of interoperable tools, accurate data, and practical standards to
enable organizations of any size to identify open source or other third-party
software, automate license compliance, and improve software supply chain
security. AboutCode software and data can provide a comprehensive solution for
some organizations, or an organization can reuse AboutCode "building blocks"
in their own systems and workflows.

The purpose of this Getting Started section is to help you understand what
software or data AboutCode projects provide so that you can determine how to
best use them to meet your requirements for software identification, license
compliance and supply chain security. Our approach is to describe common use
cases and show you how specific AboutCode capabilities apply to those use
cases.

The use cases are grouped according to 3 major topics:
- Software identification
- License compliance
- Supply chain security

If you already know which AboutCode projects you are interested in you can
find project information in the **AboutCode Projects Overview** section of the
home page of this website. Each project card provides comprehensive project
information including:
- Description
- Documentation URL
- GitHub Repository URL
- Licenses for software, data and services as applicable
- Primary language
- Platform

The projects are presented in 5 categories:
- [Applications](/#application-projects): These projects offer an application
  that you can install in the cloud or a local environment.
- [ScanCode](/#scancode-projects): These projects are components or extensions
  of ScanCode.
- [Package-URL](/#purl-projects): These projects provide tools and data to
  support the use of the PURL (Package-URL) or VERS (Version Range Specifier)
  specifications.
- [Inspectors](/#inspectors): AboutCode Inspectors are special-purpose
  analysis tools. You can run them as a ScanCode Toolkit plugin, as steps in
  a ScanCode.io pipeline, or from the command line.
- [Libraries](/#libraries): AboutCode libraries are key building blocks for
  the AboutCode software and data stack - they have also been incorporated
  into other major FOSS projects and are available for use by anyone.

If you have questions about how to apply AboutCode building blocks to your
requirements, please join one of our community meetings or on Gitter or Slack.
See our [Meetings page](/docs/about/about-meetings) for details.
