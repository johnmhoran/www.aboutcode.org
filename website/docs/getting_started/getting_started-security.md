# Security
Software security is a very broad domain. The AboutCode commmunity has focused
on the identification, reporting, triage and remediation of open source 
vulnerabilities because this fits with our core expertise in software
identification and SCA (Software Composition Analysis). We are, however, expanding our scope for software security with the recent addition of the **atom** and **chen" project to the AboutCode community, but most of our tools and data are related to software vulnerabilities.
See also [atom and chen join AboutCode](https://aboutcode-org.github.io/www.aboutcode.org/blog/atom-chen-aboutcode).

Note that our tools and data for software vulnerabilities expect that software
will be identified with a [PURL (Package-URL)](https://package-url.github.io/www.packageurl.org/docs/purl/purl-spec-introduction).

## Identify vulnerabilities
For the basic use case of identifying software vulnerabilities, AboutCode 
offers the VulnerableCode tools and data, the DejaCode application, ScanCode tools, and the PURL standard.

- [VulnerableCode](https://vulnerablecode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides
a robust set of tools to build and access a database of known software 
vulnerabilities from upstream and downstream public data sources. The 
VulnerableCode tools collect, aggregate and correlated vulnerabilities and 
maps them to package versions using PURL. 

    AboutCode hosts a public VulnerableCode database at https://public2.vulnerablecode.io/ with a Web UI for queries and an API. Access is free 
    but there are some restrictions on the frequency and volume of API 
    requests. You can use the VulnerableCode tools to build, maintain and 
    use (Web UI and APIs) your own private VCIO database.
