AboutCode has been designed as a modular stack of applications, tools,
libraries and data. All of the software is open source (primarily licensed
under [Apache-2.0](https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/apache-2.0.html))
and all of the data  is open (primarily licensed under
[CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/cc-by-sa-4.0.html)).

The AboutCode stack supports important industry standards including:

**Package-URL (PURL)**: a widely used standard to identify software
packages of any type with simple, readable and concise URLs. The PURL
standard is [ECMA-427](https://ecma-tc54.github.io/ECMA-427/).

**CycloneDX**: (OWASP CycloneDX) is a full-stack Bill of Materials (BOM)
standard ([ECMA-424](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-424/))
that provides advanced supply chain capabilities for cyber risk reduction.

**SPDX**: (System Package Data Exchange) is a [specification](https://spdx.dev/use/specifications/)
for representing systems with software components as SBOMs
(Software Bill of Materials) and other AI, data and security references.
